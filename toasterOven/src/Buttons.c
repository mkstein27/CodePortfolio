 *
 * This library provides an interface to the 4 pushbuttons on the UCSC Nucleo IO
 * shield for the Nucleo development kit.
 *
 * This library relies on continuously polling the pins connected to the 
 * pushbuttons. It then provides an event-based interface for use. The 
 * resultant output are either UpEvents or DownEvents corresponding to 
 * whether the button has been pushed-down or released.
 *
 * Be aware that the ButtonsInit() function exists for configuring the 
 * appropriate pins on the STM32 processor and must be done before 
 * ButtonsCheckEvents() will work.
